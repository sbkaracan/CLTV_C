# CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (CLTV) CALCULATION


### CLTV: Customer lifetime value is how much money a customer will bring your brand throughout their entire time as a paying customer.

### Calculations:
- Average Order Value (average_order_value = total_price / total_transaction)
- Purchase Frequency (total_transaction / total_number_of_customers)
- Repeat Rate & Churn Rate (multiple shoppers / all customers)
- Profit Margin (profit_margin =  total_price * 0.10)
- Customer Value (customer_value = average_order_value * purchase_frequency)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV = (customer_value / churn_rate) x profit_margin)


### This project is valid at the time of the analysis. Because of that, CLTV Prediction is a better and more proper project type.

#### CLTV Prediction Project is also will be on my profile soon.
